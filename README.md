# Linear-Regression-ML-Model-for-Video-Games-Sales-Prediction
A linear regression Machine Learning model using Python to predict the video games sales numbers. I used Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, and Matplotlib.

First, The dataframe was inspected, analyzed, and cleaned. After that, I encoded the categorical columns in the dataframe to ensure high quality input instead of relying on numeric columns only.

Using both categorical and numeric columns enhanced the model ability to predict scoring an accuracy of 99.97%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of only 0.000136941.
